# PySimpleGUI - ChessGUI (updated!)

Updated version of Chess GUI demo previously included in [github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/Chess](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/8b23740fca08b7f5bad3f0d32760f42a5202d3e1/Chess)
* _requirements.txt_ includes latest versions
* Removed any outdated or deprecated code causing errors
* Added compatibility for Linux, allowing users to import files that do not end in ".exe".

Note: Both chess demos have only been tested on Ubuntu 20.24 but should also work on Windows since not much was changed. Lastly, for the engine, I resulted in having to use Stockfish 13, since there was several issues when trying to use Stockfish 14 or Stockfish 15.

## Introduction
This is the start of a front-end GUI for an AI engine that plays chess.  It simply reads moves the a PGN file and steps through it showing each of the moves on the board.

To play against the AI run the program 
`Demo_Chess_AGAINST_AI.py`

Locate where the package was installed and run the programs from that folder.  You need to run from the installed folder so that the images of the chess pieces are located.
