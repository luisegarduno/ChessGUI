## Introduction
This is the start of a front-end GUI for an AI engine that plays chess.  It simply reads moves the a PGN file and steps through it showing each of the moves on the board.

To play against the AI run the program 
Demo_Chess_AGAINST_AI.py

Locate where the pacakge was installed and run the programs from that folder.  You need to run from the installed folder so that the images of the chess pieces are located.
